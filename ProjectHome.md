FTP library for Flash/Flex/AIR applications. Due to Adobe [omission (PLEASE VOTE!)](https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-6) it's not perfect, but working somehow.

Currently it's under heavy re-development. Older, almost not working;) version is hosted [here](http://maliboo.pl/projects/FlexFTP). Coming [when it's done](http://www.3drealms.com/duke4/);)
Sample upload application provided.

Found bug? Please [log it in issues](http://code.google.com/p/fl-ftp/issues/list). I don't have time for emails, so get it or forget it;) API comments, suggestions are welcome!
